  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>About me!</b><br/>Hi, I'm Jennifer.Sh. I'm an ex-teacher who has returned to academia. My background in teaching science, maths, electronics and IT gave me a great foundation for working with interdisciplinary subjects during my PhD. As well as studying drug resistance in cancer; thermal effects in nanoscale frictional phenomena; and extreme value statistics in my PhD work, I am very interested in nuclear radiation monitoring and safety.<br/><br/>Outside of academia, I am fairly active and enjoy being surrounded by nature. I thrive when being creative and I regularly spend time sewing and painting. I love trying new things and taking a project from conception of the idea to completion of the final piece. I also bring my creative side into my academic work to problem-solve and present data.<br/><br/>I originally started this website as a fun way to exercise and develop my old MySpace html skills and learn CSS, but as my PhD developed, I decided to upgrade this project to be more than just for fun!</p>
