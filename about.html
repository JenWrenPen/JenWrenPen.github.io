  <p style="text-align:justify"><b>About me!</b><br/>Hi, I'm Jennifer.Sh. I'm an ex-teacher who has returned to academia. My background in teaching science, maths, electronics and IT gave me a great foundation for working with interdisciplinary subjects during my PhD, which I successfully defended in May 2025. During my doctoral work, I studied drug resistance in cancer and thermal effects in nanoscale frictional phenomena, but still kept an interest in nuclear radiation monitoring and safety - the subject of my master's degree.<br/><br/>Outside of academia, I am fairly active and enjoy being surrounded by nature. I thrive when being creative and I regularly spend time sewing and painting. I love trying new things and taking a project from the initial spark of an idea; through all the planning and resource gathering; to the hard graft to complete the final piece. I also bring my creative side into my academic work to problem-solve and present data.<br/><br/>I started this website as a fun way to exercise and develop my old MySpace html skills and learn CSS, but I decided to upgrade this project to be an extension to my CV and show off my creative side!</p>
