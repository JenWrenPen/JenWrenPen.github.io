<h1>Dear Contestant,</h1>
<p>You must play a new format of jenga where instead of adding bricks to grow the tower, you must place them inside an empty tin on the top of the tower.</p>
<p>Before you begin, you must guess how successful you will be by predicting the number of blocks you will be able to put in the bean tin before the tower falls over.</p>
<p>Highest, closest guess wins!</p>
</div>
