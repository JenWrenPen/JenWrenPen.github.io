<h1>Dear Contestant,</h1>
<p>Make the taskmaster, Alice, a fancy hama bead coaster.</p>
<p>You have ten minutes to complete your coaster from the moment you open the packet of beads (this does not include ironing).</p>
<p>Every two minutes during the task, you must exchange unusual compliments.</p>
<p>You must be prepared to present the coaster live and explain how fancy it is.</p> 
<p>When you're ready, open the beads!</p>
