  <h1 style="font-size:25px;">Birthday Banger Bathroom Bonanza!</h1>
  <p>Saturday 11th July, time: 18:00</p>
  <p>Dear friends, acquaitances and enemies (you know who you are),</p>

<p>I would like to invite you to my birthday sausage fest and bathroom unveiling extravaganza!</p>

<p>It's actually a normal birthday party, but there'll be hotdogs of all meatitudes* and our bathroom was renovated recently, so that's pretty exciting and worth a look!</p>

<p>We'll have hotdog sausages of various kinds, bready goodness and all the regular accoutrements associated with hotdoggery. If you have a particular frankfurter niche that needs filling, let me know!</p>

<p>Bring your own beverages, unless you only want water, in which case I think our generosity can extend to provide this for you.</p>

<p>Please invite better-halfs, significant others, platonic partners or BFFs.</p>

<p>So yeah... my 29th Birthday, hotdogs, merriment, shiny new bathroom... plenty of excitement to be had!</p>

<p>Let me know if y'all can make it, although eating a lot of hotdogs by myself wouldn't be the WURST!</p>

<p>If you don't know where I live, please see figures 1 and 2 below!</p>

<p>Lots of love,</p>

<p>Jenny</p>

<p>PS, "Banger" is another word for sausage in "British" in case you wanted to know. </p>

<p>*Meatitudes range from vegan to animal.
