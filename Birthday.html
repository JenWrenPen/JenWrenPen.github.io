  <h1 style="font-size:25px;">Birthday Banger Bathroom Bonanza!</h1>
  <p>Saturday 11th July, time: TBD</p>
  <p>Dear friends, acquaitances and <br>enemies (you know who you are),</p>

<p>I would like to invite you to my birthday <br>sausage fest and bathroom unveiling extravaganza!</p>

<p>It's actually a normal birthday party, but there'll <br>be hotdogs of all meatitudes* and our bathroom was <br>renovated recently, so that's pretty exciting and worth a look!</p>

<p>We'll have hotdog sausages of various kinds, bready <br>goodness and all the regular accoutrements associated <br>with hotdoggery. If you have a particular frankfurter niche <br>that needs filling, let me know!</p>

<p>Bring your own beverages, unless you only want water, <br>in which case I think our generosity can extend to provide <br>this for you.</p>

<p>Please invite better-halfs, significant others, <br>platonic partners or BFFs.</p>

<p>So yeah... my 29th Birthday, hotdogs, merriment, shiny <br>new bathroom... plenty of excitement to be had!</p>

<p>Hope y'all can make it, although eating a lot of <br>hotdogs by myself wouldn't be the WURST!</p>

<p>If you don't know where I live, send me a message!</p>

<p>Lots of love,</p>

<p>Jenny</p>

<p>PS, "Banger" is another word for sausage in "British" in <br>case you wanted to know. </p>

<p>*Meatitudes range from vegan to animal.
