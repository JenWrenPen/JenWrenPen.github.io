  <p>Welcome to my Christmas card
<br>I made it digital this time
<br>So I sent you this URL
<br>And I wrote this festive rhyme
<br>I'd like to talk about all the things
<br>That have happened this year
<br>But like last year there isn't much
<br>Oh at least Christmas is here
<br><br>At least it's Christmas
<br>Just say whatever
<br>Rewrite a song, I think I'm ever so clever
<br>Eat, drink and be merry
<br>Rapid test with me
<br>At least it's Christmas
<br>Please take vaccine three
<br>
